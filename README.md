Learning to use GitHub on Visual Studio 2013


Just me trying to figure out how to use GitHub from Visual Studio 2013

There is also an example of using event in C#. Might as well make something
Since I'm posting random stuff here, right?

Anyways, this is pretty basic stuff, so I don't think that many people will 
learn anything from it.

I also think there are a few mistakes with it, as I didn't really proof read it.
It does function though ^^;
